<p style="color:yellow">This is a Chinese meat pie, or ham bao.  They are generally filled with a spiced minced pork or beef, some onion and other vegetable. They are best eaten just after they have cooled enough so they don't burn your mouth.  The outside wrapper is crunchy to bite but soft to chew and the meat is savory and you must be careful not to let the juice drip out of the pie after you bite it, it would be a shame to waste it.</p>
